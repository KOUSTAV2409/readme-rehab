## 🧠 Why This Exists
Open source is a gift — not a checkbox.  
Every pull request should add *value*, not *volume*.  

Many beginners are told:  
> “Make PRs to learn open source.”  
But no one tells them *how* or *where* to start safely.  

So this repo exists to help you:
- Learn Git and GitHub commands.
- Understand the pull request workflow.
- Practice, fail, and learn — without harming real production projects.

✅ Add your name, emoji, or quote in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`.

✅ Experiment with Markdown formatting.

## 🚫 What You Shouldn’t Do (Out There)
- Don’t make random PRs to production-level repos.  
- Don’t chase contribution counts for résumé points.  
- Don’t treat open source like a vanity metric.

## ❤️ Final Words
This repo isn’t a joke — it’s a message.
